# Description
Welcome to my Full-stack portfolio. This page allows others to see current projects and read about my experience as a developer. A brief description of my programming background can be found in the 'About' section. Also included, are projects that challenge my understanding of Javascript and CSS. 

This portfolio is updated regularly as I broaden my understanding of web development. 

# Demo
